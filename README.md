## üìö Learning

I discovered the Thor gem through GoRails and decided to build a CLI application using the Thor gem.
I managed to build a CLI application with a clear description of the commands and options. I tried to make the folder structure as organized as possible, separating the concerns of the application (services, models, librairies, etc.).
Thor seems like a viable option for building CLI applications in Ruby.
